# GEC-clone DataSet
Each data point in the GEC-clone dataset includes two distinct code implementations. Although this paper does not focus on code cloning research, the GEC dataset provides different code implementations for the same functionality for each problem. Notably, the GEC-clone dataset is specifically designed for semantic clone research. In other words, the GEC-clone dataset aims to investigate functional similarities between two code implementations.
